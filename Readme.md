## About

The Berkah Jaya Store app was built with the aim of helping small and medium businesses in managing store item data. We here want to improve existing management by computerizing it to increase profits and speed in managing existing item data. The Berkah Jaya App has five superior features, including:

1. **Melihat data barang**, Berkah Jaya Store displays the entire stock of items available in the database, and you will always get the latest updates from your database.
2. **Tambah data barang**, Berkah Jaya Store helps you register new items and update existing items, such as name,quantity,price or information.
3. **Delete data barang**, Berkah Jaya Store provides high mobility to remove items that you do not need or have expired.
4. **Update data barang**,Toko Berkah Jaya provides high mobility to update item data which will be updated when there is a data error when adding item data.
5. **Pembelian data barang**, Berkah Jaya Store provides an experience for customers to purchase and pay for any item from anywhere at any time.
